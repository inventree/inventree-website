### Governance and Security

In preparation for the upcoming InvenTree 1.0 release, we released new pages detailing [project governance](https://docs.inventree.org/en/latest/project/governance/) and [security policies](https://docs.inventree.org/en/latest/project/security/).
It is recommended to read the [threat modelling document](https://docs.inventree.org/en/latest/concepts/threat_model/), which outlines the security considerations for deploying InvenTree instances.
