Introducing the new InvenTree website!

InvenTree now has a new website (the one you're looking at right now), which is intended to act as a landing page for anyone wanting to learn more about InvenTree. This new website will provide general information about what InvenTree *is* and how it can be used. 

We will share periodic updates on new features, which provides greater visibility into what the latest-and-greatest versions of InvenTree have to offer.

Additionally as the InvenTree community grows, we'll share information on new plugins, or feature "show and tell" sections in our blog to show how InvenTree is being used around the world!

### Documentation

inventree.org will no longer host the InvenTree software documentation. Documentation has been moved to [docs.inventree.org](https://docs.inventree.org)

### Demo Server

The [demo server](/demo.md) remains available at [demo.inventree.org](https://demo.inventree.org)

### Credits

Thanks to [@matmair](https://github.com/matmair) for bringing the new website into existence
