Getting ready for 0.10.0, Website Updates and the Plugin List.

### Preparations for 0.10.0

Since the last release, we've been working on the next version of InvenTree, which will be 0.10.0. There are already 85 PRs merged into the `master` branch, and we're expecting to release 0.10.0 in the next few weeks. 

There will be a full blog post once we release but here are a few perks to look for:
- The option to use [Slovenian](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/4072). Around 7% are already translated - we need your help to get that number up. Head over to the [translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/inventree) if you want to help with any language.
- Attach the current order schedule to your calendar ([3858](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/3858))
- Improvements for report rendering ([4081](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/4081)) and a lot of improvements to the docs
- Get orders by their reference via the API ([4083](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/4083))
- Improvements for SSO - including the UI ([4169](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/4169), [4263](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/4263)), better separation between local and SSO user management ([4171](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/4171)) and restricting signups to specific domains ([4172](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/4172))
- Include alternative parts in your BOM exports ([4203](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/4203))
- A simple priority field for order ([4225](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/4225))

### Website Updates

The website got some UI fixes for mobile users and gained more icons. We also added a [team section](https://inventree.org/about/team) and moved away from cookie-based analytics.

### Plugin List

A new feature landed: the [plugin list](https://inventree.org/plugins). Check out the blog post for more details.
