title: Fund InvenTree
---

Sponsorships help to keep the InvenTree project sustainable, and buys time for the core developers to commit to the project.

A recurring or one off sponsorship is a great way to help InvenTree development to continue at full steam!

The work undertaken to keep InvenTree running is done by a very small group of core developers, who do so in their spare time (and are not sponsored by their employers to work on InvenTree). If you benefit from the InvenTree project, please consider contributing to maintain vibrant development of this software!

If you are using InvenTree in a commercial setting, please consider sponsoring the project to help support ongoing development and maintenance. Your support is greatly appreciated and helps to ensure that InvenTree remains a viable and sustainable project for years to come.

## GitHub Sponsors

A great way if you already have a GitHub account, and want to support the project with a one-off or recurring sponsorship. You will be invoiced by GitHub, and can manage your sponsorships via your GitHub account.

## Polar

If your company benefits from InvenTree, please consider a [one time sponsorship](https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_d7lPAgS9jnW8NDOSWATqdz2gs3wUD1x5M5o7C2rPoAL) or a [recurring sponsorship](https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_UlGc3bUjwB7Vx89dhAY2iF3kUIVFBJC5mJyow4NlJa6) to help support the project.

## Polar App

The InvenTree app can also be bought as a one off purchase as a APK download from the [Polar app store](https://polar.sh/checkout/polar_c_dlEdsMuIlGPGS5Cb6DB82cRwuwpfPErjF7U4j1NfdYd). This is a great way to support the project if you are using the mobile app and do not want to use Google Play.

## PayPal

PayPal is a great way to provide a one-off sponsorship, and does not require you to have a GitHub account.
