title: Get Support
---

As an open source project we offer a [public issue tracker](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree) and [public documentation](https://docs.inventree.org).

## General Questions
The core team answers questions in the issue tracker of in [discussions](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/discussions) when they find time.  
Private questions (via DM, email, etc.) are generally not answered, use the public forums.

## Custom Features
If you require a custom feature you can either:
- Suggest the feature on the issue tracker as a [Feature Request](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/issues/new?template=feature_request.yaml)
- Implement the feature yourself, and contribute back to the project. InvenTree developers will happily help you work through any issues.
- Create a [plugin]({% link extend/plugin/index.md %})
- Request a paid customisation
