# InvenTree website
This project contains the source for InvenTree's website. It is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a static website generator.

## Installation

To install the required components on your local machine, run the following command:

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

To launch a local development server, run:

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
