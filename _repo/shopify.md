A simple Integration into Shopify.

Let your orders from Shopify be created in autopilot, update your Inventory-Levels from InvenTree and vice-versa.

## Installation

1. Navigate to your InvenTree directory and cd into `src/InvenTree/plugins` and execute `git submodule add https://github.com/matmair/ShopifyIntegrationPlugin` there. Enable plugins in the general plugin settings and reload InvenTree.
2. Add a private app to your Shopify store (please register as a dev and use a development store. This is a PoC)
3. Go to the InvenTree settings and fill in the settings for the ShopifyIntegrationPlugin from your new private app.
4. Check out the new navigation tab.

## Caveat

Your instance must be reachable for webhooks from Shopify so use ngrok or something like that to expose your instance with HTTPS.

## State of the code

This code is bad. It is neither optimized nor is it CI/Cd ready or covered in any way.
I use this Plugin as a PoC to show what will be possible with the new system.

## Contribute

The whole plugin system is currently not even in the dev branch.
Feel free to submit issues or just send me a mail to dev AT mjmair.com


## No open source?

Currently I have defined no license so forking is a bad idea copyright-wise. This code should not be used as basis for anything - I will define a license once the plugin system gets released.
