## Translation Support

The InvenTree app is designed to support multiple language translations.

As with the web application, translations are community contributed - if the app does not support your native language, contributions are very welcome!

## Contributing

Translation for the InvenTree mobile app is provided by the [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/inventree) service. Contributions are welcomed and encouraged, and the process of providing or improving translated strings is extremely simple!

Full translation efforts, while appreciated, are not required. Please feel free to contribute as much as you can!
