## DigitalOcean Open Source Credits

DigitalOcean is kind enough to provide open source projects with free credits to use their services.  
InvenTree is a proud recipient of these credits and is currently switching the demo instance to use a droplet. If you are interested in applying for credits, you can do so [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/open-source/credits-for-projects).
