InvenTree is an open source project which is supported by a small group of volunteer contributors. Developing and maintaining an open source project is a lot of work, and requires a lot of developer time, a resource which is quite scarce.

We welcome everyone to help with InvenTree however they can!

Check out the [starter issues](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Astarter) if you are looking for a good place to get started.

### Translate

InvenTree provides a translation layer for both the web interface and mobile app. Native language translation requires effort from translators to provide multi-lingual support. If you wish to translate InvenTree to a new language (or improve an existing translation), such contributions would be greatly appreciated!.

Native language translations of the InvenTree web application and mobile app are [community contributed via crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/inventree).

_**Contributions are welcomed and encouraged!**._

To contribute to the translation effort, navigate to the [InvenTree crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/inventree), create a free account, and start making translations for your language of choice!

### Documentation

Documenting a large software project is a challenging and ongoing effort. If you are able to provide assistance in improving the documentation set, please consider doing so! Documentation contributions can be made on [GitHub](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/tree/master/docs).

If you see any sections of the documentation that require work (i.e. denoted with "TODO") - please consider providing assistance in these sections!
