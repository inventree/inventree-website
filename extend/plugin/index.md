We supply core-dev and community built plugins to get you started with extending InvenTree's functionality. Plugins can hook into many parts of the UI, buisness logic and webserver.

We expose some internal Python APIs to speed up your development and keep the instance running while you discover the possibilities.

You can read more about the plugin architecture, including information on developing new plugins, on our [documentation](https://docs.inventree.org/en/latest/extend/plugins/)

### Highlights

Add *native printing capabilities* for your network connected printers to the webinterface and apps. There are plugins for:
- [Brother QL](https://pypi.org/project/inventree-brother-plugin/)
- [Zebra](https://github.com/SergeoLacruz/inventree-zebra-plugin)

### Plugin repo

You can find all tagged plugins on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/search/?q=inventree-plugin) and [GitHub](https://github.com/topics/inventreeplugins).

We also offer a [plugin repo](../../plugins.html) with a community driven list of plugins. We encourage you to add your own plugins.
