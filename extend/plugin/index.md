We supply core-dev and community built plugins to get you started with extending InvenTree's functionality. Plugins can hook into many parts of the UI, buisness logic and webserver.
We expose some internal python APIs to speed up your development and keep the instance running while you discover the possibilities.

You can read more about the plugin architecture, including information on developing new plugins, on our [documentation](https://docs.inventree.org/en/latest/extend/plugins/)

### Highlights
