## Release Notes

For a full list of changes made in this release, please see the [release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/releases/tag/0.16.0).

## Breaking Changes

This release includes a number of changes which adjust existing APIs and may require updates to custom code or scripts.

### Report Printing Refactor

In [PR #7074](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/7074), the report printing system has received a major refactor. This change has been a long time coming, and we are excited to see it finally merged into the main branch.

Previously, each report template type was stored in a separate database table. All reports have now been consolidated into a single table, which simplifies the codebase and makes it easier to manage report templates.

A similar single table has been implemented for label templates.

Additionally, the report template live editor has received some improvements, making it easier to create and edit report templates directly within the InvenTree interface.

This change has removed a number of existing API endpoints, as all report functionality is consolidated to a smaller set of API commands. Refer to the InvenTree API documentation for more information.

### Attachment Refactor

In [PR #7420](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/7420), all attachment tables have been consolidated into a single table. This code change results in a large number of redundant API endpoints being removed, and simplifies the codebase. As all attachments are now stored in a single table, any custom plugins which interact with attachments will need to be updated to reflect this change.

### Plugin Static File Management

We have changed the way that static files for plugins are handled. Previously only plugins which used the "app mixin" system could include static files. Now, all plugins can include static files, which are automatically loaded by the InvenTree system.

Refer to [PR #7763](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/7763) for more information.

### Plugin API Lookup

In [PR #7224](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/7224) the plugin API was changed to use the "slug" of the plugin as the primary lookup, rather than the unique ID in the database. This change simplifies the plugin API and makes it easier to manage plugins, allowing consistent access to plugin data.

## Security Patches

A number of critical security updates have been made. For a full list, refer to the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A0.16.0+label%3Asecurity).

### Dependency Updates

We have updated a number of dependencies to address security vulnerabilities. These updates are part of our ongoing commitment to security and privacy. While there have been a significant number of dependency updates in this release cycle, below is a list of PRs which address security vulnerabilities:

- https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/7839
- https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/7827
- https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/7620
- https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/7430

### 2FA Login Fix

2FA authentication for the new React frontend has been fixed in [PR #7469](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/7469).

### Frontend SBOMs

[PR #7784](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/7784) generates SBOMs for the frontend, providing detailed information on the dependencies used in the frontend codebase.

## New Features

This has been a significant release cycle for new features, with a number of exciting additions to the InvenTree codebase. There are so many new updates here that we can't list them all, some of the highlights include:

### User Interface Improvements

Major improvements have been made to the new React frontend, with a number of new features and enhancements. The new frontend is now the primary focus of development, and we are working to migrate all frontend code to React. From this point onwards, major bug fixes and security patches will still be applied to the old frontend, but new features will only be added to the React frontend.

### Data Import / Export

We have been working on an entire rewrite of the data import and export system. This new system is more robust and flexible, and allows for more complex data import and export operations. This system is now live in the new React frontend, and we are excited to see it in action.

Future work will focus on bringing all import/export functionality across to the new system, and removing the old import/export system entirely.

### Validation Plugin Enhancements

The validation plugin system has been significantly enhanced to provide greater flexibility for custom validation options.

### API Documentation

The API documentation has been enhanced, and is now built automatically from the InvenTree codebase and included in the [InvenTree documentation](https://docs.inventree.org).

## Bug Fixes

Our commitment to bug fixes continues, with a number of issues resolved in this release cycle. For a full list of bug fixes, refer to the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A0.16.0+label%3Abug).

Many of these bugs have been identified and fixed by our community of users, and we are grateful for their ongoing support! If you identify a bug in InvenTree, please report it to us on our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/inventree/inventree/issues).
