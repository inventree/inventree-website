## Rolling Stocktake Plugin

The InvenTree development team has released a new plugin which provides a "Rolling Stocktake" mechanism for InvenTree.

This plugin encourgaes users to perform regular stocktakes of inventory items in a rolling fashion, ensuring that stock levels are consistently accurate without the need for a complete inventory shutdown.

By presenting users with a dashboard widget that highlights stock items that are overdue for stocktake, the plugin helps maintain inventory accuracy and reduces the risk of stock discrepancies.

For more information about the plugin, please refer to the [plugin reference](/extend/plugin/inventree-rolling-stocktake.md) or the [GitHub page](https://github.com/inventree/rolling-stocktake-plugin).
