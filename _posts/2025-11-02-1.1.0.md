## 1.1.0 Release

The InvenTree team is excited to announce the release of version 1.1.0.

This is the first major update since our [1.0.0 stable release]({% link _posts/2025-09-15-1.0.0.md %}), and includes numerous new features, improvements, and bug fixes to enhance your experience with InvenTree.

### Changelog

Major changes are documented in the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the InvenTree repository.

For a full list of changes made in this release, please refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/releases/tag/1.1.0).

### Update Procedure

To update to the latest version of InvenTree, please follow the updating instructions provided in the [InvenTree documentation](https://docs.inventree.org). Note that the particular update procedure may vary depending on your installation method.

## New Features

### Partial Build Output Complete

[#10499](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/10499) adds the ability to complete only a partial quantity of a build output. This allows for finer control over the manufacturing process.

### Build Output Adjustments

[#10600](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/10600) allows users to perform stock adjustment actions (count, transfer, etc) on stock items which are in production, i.e. associated with a build output. This provides greater flexibility in managing stock during the manufacturing process.

### Report Helper Functions

There have been several additions to the report helper functions, in particular relating to maths and currency operations. Refer to the report documentation for more information on how to use these new functions.

### Supplier Part Attachments

In [#10724](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/10724) we added support for uploading attachments against supplier parts. This allows users to associate relevant documents (e.g. datasheets, certifications, etc) directly with supplier parts.

## Bug Fixes

There have been a significant number of [bug fixes](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pulls?q=is%3Apr%20label%3Abug%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A1.1.0) in this release. Thanks to the many community members who have contributed to identifying and resolving these issues!

### Financial Support

Sponsorships help to keep this project sustainable, and buys time for the core developers to commit to the project. A recurring or one off sponsorship is a great way to help InvenTree development to continue at full steam!

The work undertaken to keep InvenTree running is done by a very small group of core developers, who do so in their spare time (and are not sponsored by their employers to work on InvenTree). If you benefit from the InvenTree project, please consider contributing to maintain vibrant development of this software!
