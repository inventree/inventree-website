title: 0.12.8 Bugfix Release
---

The InvenTree development team is proud to announce the release of [version 0.12.8](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/releases/tag/0.12.8), which provides fixes for a number of bugs reported by out community of users.

## Currency Exchange

One key issue addressed in this release is a fix for fetching exchange rate information from the internet.

To date, InvenTree has made use of the [exchangerate.host](https://exchangerate.host/) service for updating currency exchange rate data. This has (until now) been provided as a free service which did not require authentication.

However recent changes to the exchangerate backend have broken our exchange rate implementation, and required an immediate fix.

### frankfurter.app

For now, the quick approach to get everyone up and running again is to migrate to using the [frankfurter.app](https://www.frankfurter.app/) API. This provides a near-identical API, without needing an API key or paid subscription.

### Future Improvements

Future work on supporting exchange rates will involve supporting different backend APIs, including the ability for users to provide their own API keys. We will also implement the ability for custom plugins to provide exchange rate data - allowing users to define their own exchange rate interface if required.

## Other Improvements
