title: 1.2.0 Release
---

The InvenTree team is excited to announce the release of version 1.2.0. Attention: This release has no support for PostgreSQL 13 - our docs contain information regading [PostgreSQL updates](https://docs.inventree.org/en/latest/start/migrate/#migrating-between-incompatible-database-versions). At least PostgreSQL 14 is required, we recommend PostgreSQL 18.

This release includes numerous new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

### Changelog

Major changes are documented in the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the InvenTree repository.

For a full list of changes made in this release, please refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/releases/tag/1.2.0).

### Update Procedure

To update to the latest version of InvenTree, please follow the updating instructions provided in the [InvenTree documentation](https://docs.inventree.org). Note that the particular update procedure may vary depending on your installation method.

## Breaking Changes

### Django Update

[#10730](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/10730) updated the core Django version to 5.2 lts.

As part of this update, the following breaking changes have been introduced:

#### PostgreSQL 14

The minimum supported version of PostgreSQL has been increased to 14. This means that users running PostgreSQL 13 will need to perform a manual update of their database in order to continue using InvenTree with the latest version. For more information, please refer to our [update guide]({% link _posts/2026-02-12-db-update.md %}) for a walkthrough of the database update procedure.

#### Python 3.11
The minimum supported python version has been increased to 3.11. This means that users running Python 3.10 or earlier will need to update their python installation in order to run InvenTree 1.2.0.

### API changes

[#11035](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/11035) all metadata endpoints were unified into a generic one.

[#11021](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/11021) tags were removed from a few APIs by default, they can be enabled using a dedicated filter if need be

## New Features

### Generic Parameters

[#10699](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/10699) adds support for generic parameters across multiple model types. Previously, parameters were only support for parts.

### PDF Input Controls

Sponsorships help to keep this project sustainable, and buys time for the core developers to commit to the project. A recurring or one off sponsorship is a great way to help InvenTree development to continue at full steam!

The work undertaken to keep InvenTree running is done by a very small group of core developers, who do so in their spare time (and are not sponsored by their employers to work on InvenTree). If you benefit from the InvenTree project, please consider contributing to maintain vibrant development of this software!
