<p>Once again, the InvenTree development team has had a very busy year! In 2023, we have released 3 major stable versions of the InvenTree software, with a significant number of new features and improvements. It is also worth noting that we have had a huge number of new contributors to the project, and we would like to thank everyone who has helped make this possible!</p>

<h3 id="release-milestones">Release Milestones</h3>

<p>This was a very active year for the project, especially in terms of core software development. A huge array of new features have been implemented, and significant performance improvements have been made across the board.</p>

<h4 id="0100">0.10.0</h4>

<p>In February, we released <a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/releases/tag/0.10.0">version 0.10.0</a>, with over 100 commits from 6 contributors (including 3 new contributors).</p>

<h4 id="0110">0.11.0</h4>

<p>In April, we released <a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/releases/tag/0.11.0">version 0.11.0</a>. Again, this release included contributions from 3 new developers, which was very exciting! With 142 commits to the project, this was again a significant release milestone.</p>

<h4 id="0120">0.12.0</h4>

<p>In June, we released <a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/releases/tag/0.12.0">version 0.12.0</a>. Once again, this release included contributions from 3 new developers, and included a huge number of new features and improvements. The 0.12.0 release included 237 commits from 14 contributors, making it the most significant release of InvenTree to date!</p>

<h3 id="developers">Developers</h3>

<p>We now have over 75 developers who have contributed to the project, with many new developers making their first contribution in 2023. We would like to thank everyone who has contributed to the project, and we hope to see many more developers getting involved in the future!</p>

<h3 id="translation-effort">Translation Effort</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/inventree">language translation effort</a> continues to build momentum, with over 30 languages now supported by the project. There are also over 300 contributors to the translation effort, which is incredible! It is very exciting to see InvenTree being used by people all over the world, and working to translate it into their native language.</p>

<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://crowdin.com">crowdin project</a> which makes this possible!</p>

<h3 id="digital-ocean-sponsorship">Digital Ocean Sponsorship</h3>

<p>In 2023 we were honoured to receive a sponsorship from <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>. This sponsorship funds hosting for the InvenTree demo server instance, and we are very grateful for their support! If you are looking for a cloud hosting provider, consider using Digital Ocean.</p>

<h3 id="kicad-integration">KiCad Integration</h3>

<p>In September 2023, we were happy to announce that InvenTree can now be used as a <a href="/blog/2023/09/26/kicad.html">KiCad symbol library</a>, using a custom plugin developed by one of our users. This is a huge step forward for the project, and allows InvenTree to be used as a first-class symbol library for KiCad.</p>

<h3 id="chaos-computer-club-talk">Chaos Computer Club Talk</h3>

<p>In December, Matthias, one of our lead developers, presented a lightning talk on InvenTree at the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/infos/index.html">Chaos Communication Congress</a>, which received a lot of positive feedback. It was a great opportunity to showcase the project to a wider audience, and we hope to see more people getting involved in the project as a result.</p>

<p>You can view the talk online <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/37c3-lightningtalks-58014-inventree-oss-inventory-and-plm">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="upcoming-in-2024">Upcoming in 2024</h2>

<p>It is hard to believe that we are already in 2024! We have a lot of exciting plans for the project this year, and we are looking forward to seeing what the year brings.</p>

<h3 id="outstanding-issues">Outstanding Issues</h3>

<p>At the time of writing this blog, there are over <a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/issues">180 outstanding issues</a> in the project. This is largely due to an influx of new users, who have been reporting bugs and requesting new features. We are working hard to address these issues, and we hope to see the number of outstanding issues decrease over the coming months.</p>

<p>Attracting new developer talent to the project is a key goal for 2024, and we hope to see many new developers getting involved in the project. If you use InvenTree and would like to help out, please read our contribution guide and get in touch!</p>

<h3 id="issue-funding">Issue Funding</h3>

<p>In an effort to focus developer attention, and also potentially attract new developers to the project, we will be experimenting with a new funding model for the project. This would allow users to fund the development of specific issues, and would allow us to focus our efforts on the most important issues.</p>

<p>Moving forward, we will be tagging specific issues with a <em>funding</em> label, which will indicate that the issue is available for funding. If you would like to see a specific issue addressed, please consider funding it!</p>

<p>Funds allocated to a specific issue will be shared between the developers who work on the issue, as well as the maintainers of the InvenTree project.</p>

<p>We are making use of the <a href="https://polar.sh">polar.sh</a> platform to manage the funding process. Please note that we are not affiliated with polar.sh, we are simply using it as a tool to manage the funding process.</p>

<p>We will <em>not</em> be asking for funding for every issue, and we will continue to work on issues which are not funded!</p>

<h3 id="user-interface-refactor">User Interface Refactor</h3>

<p>We are continuing to work towards the goal of <a href="/blog/2023/08/28/react">refactoring the user interface</a>. This is a major project and will take some time to complete.</p>

<p>While the new frontend is progressing well, we would love to see more developers getting involved in the project. In particular, we are looking for support from front-end developers who have experience with React. If you would like to help out, please get in touch!</p>

<h3 id="plugin-system">Plugin System</h3>

<p>The plugin system has been a major focus of development in 2023, and we hope to see this continue in 2024. We are working towards a more flexible plugin system, which will allow for more complex plugins to be developed.</p>

<p>As more users (both individuals and businesses) start to use InvenTree, we have seen a significant increase in demand for custom plugins. In particular, we have received a lot of interest in plugins providing integration with other business / enterprise software systems. To allow this, the plugin system does need further development, and we hope to see this happen in 2024.</p>

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>

<p>The InvenTree development team is very small, and we are always looking for help with documentation. If you are able to contribute to the project by helping us with documentation, please reach out to us. Writing good quality documentation is a real skill, and just as crucial to a software project as the code itself. If you have any experience or interest in technical writing, please consider helping us out!</p>

<h2 id="sponsor-the-project">Sponsor the Project</h2>

<p>There are now many businesses (small and large) using InvenTree to support their operations. If you are using InvenTree in your business, please consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/inventree/">sponsoring the project</a>. The InvenTree project is maintained by developers in their “spare” time, and financial sponsorship allows us to dedicate more time to the project.</p>

</ul>

<p>Additionally, we have had a huge surge in community contributions for translations! There are now multiple languages with almost 100% translation coverage. Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the translation effort!</p>

<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>

<p>This release includes a number of major new features. Some of the highlights include:</p>

<h3 id="plugin-improvements">Plugin Improvements</h3>

<p>Multiple improvements have been made to the InvenTree plugin system:</p>

<h4 id="auto-reload">Auto Reload</h4>

<p>The plugin registry is now automatically reloaded when a new plugin is installed or updated. This means that new plugins can be installed without restarting the server. Additionally, the new reloading system ensures that the background worker thread is always running the same plugin version as the web server.</p>

<h4 id="auto-migration">Auto Migration</h4>

<p>Adds the ability to automatically run database migrations when a new plugin is installed. This allows plugins to add new database models, and automatically migrate the database when the plugin is installed.</p>

<h4 id="improved-installation">Improved Installation</h4>

<p>The plugin installation process has been improved, with handling for a number of edge cases.</p>

<h4 id="exchange-rate-plugin">Exchange Rate Plugin</h4>

<p>Exchange rate support has now been exposed to the plugin interface. This allows plugins to provide exchange rate data to the InvenTree system. The default exchange rate backend can now be overridden by a custom plugin if required.</p>

<h3 id="label-printing">Label Printing</h3>

<p>The label printing system has been improved, allowing for greater flexibility in label design. The label printing system now supports:</p>

<h4 id="multi-label-printing">Multi Label Printing</h4>

<p>The label printing system now allows for multiple labels to printed at once onto a single page. <a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/5883">PR #5833</a> adds a builtin label printing plugin for printing an array of labels to PDF.</p>

<h4 id="printing-options">Printing Options</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/5837">PR #5873</a> adds the ability to specify printing options at “print time”, with the options set based on the selected plugin. Extending the label printing API with dynamic options allows printing plugins to be more flexible.</p>

<h3 id="barcode-scanning">Barcode Scanning</h3>

<p>Barcode scanning support received some significant improvements in this release:</p>

<h4 id="vendor-barcode-scanning">Vendor Barcode Scanning</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/5509">PR #5509</a> presents major new functionality for barcode scanning. InvenTree now supports a number of vendor barcodes. Incoming goods can be scanned directly into stock, and received against a purchase order. Read <a href="/blog/2023/10/29/barcodes">our blog post</a> for a more detailed overview of the new barcode scanning features.</p>

<h4 id="allocate-items-to-sales-order">Allocate Items to Sales Order</h4>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/6072">PR #6072</a> we added the ability to allocate stock items to a sales order via barcode scanning. This allows for a more streamlined workflow when picking stock items for a sales order.</p>

<h3 id="token-authentication">Token Authentication</h3>

<p>We have improved support for token based authentication. Each user can now have multiple authentication tokens, which can be used to authenticate with the InvenTree API. This allows for more fine-grained control over API access. Tokens can be revoked at any time, and have an expiry date.</p>

<h2 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h2>

<p>As well as new features, this release includes a number of bug fixes and improvements. We would like to thank everyone who has contributed to the project, and helped to identify and fix bugs! A key part of keeping InvenTree stable is the help of our users, who report bugs and help us to fix them. Please refer to GitHub for a <a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A0.13.0+label%3Abug+">complete list of bugs we have squashed</a></p>

<h2 id="user-interface-refactor">User Interface Refactor</h2>

<p>We have continued to work towards the goal of <a href="/blog/2023/08/28/react">refactoring the user interface</a>. The new frontend is progressing well, and we hope to have it fully available for the next release. The new frontend is written in React, and will provide a more modern user interface for InvenTree.</p>

<p>There are still a number of features which are not yet available in the new frontend, and we are working hard to ensure that the new frontend is feature complete before we release it. Please consider contributing to the frontend development effort if you would like to help out!</p>

<h2 id="support-for-inventree">Support for InvenTree</h2>

The label printing code has received a major overhaul to allow greater flexibility for label printing plugins, and enabling new features which were not previously possible.</p>

<h3 id="label-printing-plugins">Label Printing Plugins</h3>

<p>Previously, we had separate concepts for “native label printing” and “printing via plugins”, with different software pipelines for each. This meant that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We had a lot of duplicated or inefficient code</li>
  <li>External printing plugins did not have the same available features</li>
</ul>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/5251">#5251</a> we refactored the label printing codebase entirely, and now all label printing is handled via plugins. A builtin plugin is provided which simply renders a single label as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdf</code> file (maintaining previous behavior).</p>

<p>The refactor also provided a number of significant improvements and new functionality:</p>

<h4 id="background-printing">Background Printing</h4>

<p>Printing plugins can run in the <em>foreground</em> - and return a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdf</code> object - or in the <em>background</em>. Background printing plugins return a response immediately (to prevent blocking of the web application) and the printing is offloaded to the background worker process. This allows flexibility to (for example) communicate with an external physical printing device.</p>

<h4 id="multiple-labels">Multiple Labels</h4>

<p>Before this refactor, plugins received each label individually, with a single “print job” being sent to the printing plugin for each selected label. This was inefficient, and also meant that the printing plugin did not have the flexibility to handle simultaneous printing of multiple labels.</p>

<p>Now, printing plugins have access to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print_labels</code> method, which receives <em>all</em> labels to be printed. If desired, multiple labels could be printed together onto a single paper sheet (<em>an example of this is below</em>).</p>

<p>The default implementation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print_labels</code> simply calls the existing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print_label</code> method in sequence for each separate label - maintaining backwards compatibility for existing plugins.</p>

<h3 id="printing-options">Printing Options</h3>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/5786">PR #5786</a> we introduced the concept of “printing options”. Each printing plugin can provide a set of printing options which are presented to the user before initiating label printing. This allows for greater flexibility for label printing plugins.</p>

<p>For example, these run-time options could be used to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select paper size</li>
  <li>Switch between multiple connected printers</li>
  <li>Specify the number of copies of each label to print</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="label-sheets">Label Sheets</h3>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/5883">PR #5883</a>, a builtin plugin was developed to print multiple labels to a single “sheet”. This could be used to print a set of labels onto a specialized label sheet with peelable labels, or just a sheet of paper where the individual labels can be cut from the sheet.</p>

<p>This plugin also provides an example of how the <a href="#printing-options">printing options</a> can be used to customize printing behavior at runtime.</p>

<h4 id="example">Example</h4>

<p>The images below demonstrate how the new label sheet plugin works.</p>

<p><strong>Select Items to Print</strong></p>

<p>Select a number of individual stock items, for which labels will be printed:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/select-labels.png" alt="Select Items" /></p>

<p><strong>Label Printing Dialog</strong></p>

<p>Select the <em>InvenTree Sheet Label Printer</em> plugin:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/printer-dialog.png" alt="Select printer" /></p>

<p><strong>Print Labels</strong></p>

<p>Labels are printed in a regular grid on the resulting sheet. Note that the first three cells have been skipped, as per the selected option in the printing dialog:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/print-labels.png" alt="Print labels" /></p>

<h3 id="available-soon">Available Soon</h3>

To help streamline inventory management processes, the InvenTree development community has recently introduced some major new barcode features.</p>

<h3 id="barcode-workflows">Barcode Workflows</h3>

<p>To date, InvenTree has provided relatively simple “workflows” for barcode scanning. Scanning a barcode returns information about the database item associated with that barcode - such as a stock item, supplier part, purchase order, etc. This already allows users to perform many stock operations using barcode scanning - and is integrated into the native mobile app.</p>

<p>Recent updates (such as <a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/5509">this pull request</a>) have started to introduce more complex barcode workflows, which will allow for context sensitive barcode actions.</p>

<h3 id="ecia-barcodes-for-purchase-orders">ECIA Barcodes for Purchase Orders</h3>

<p>Many electronics manufacturers provide data-rich barcodes on items received against incoming purchase orders. The <em>Electronics Component Industry Association</em> (ECIA) has developed a <a href="https://ecia.identificationlabs.com">2D barcode standard</a> which is now implemented by a number of major electronics suppliers.</p>

<p>Purchase orders line items received from these suppliers are often provided with comprehensive barcodes, such as the example below, from Digikey:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/digikey-barcode.png" alt="Digikey Barcode" /></p>

<p>This 2D barcode contains the following data fields (and other information):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Purchase order reference</li>
  <li>Manufacturer part number (MPN)</li>
  <li>Digikey part number</li>
  <li>Item quantity</li>
</ul>

<p>These data are sufficient to receive stock items into the InvenTree database with a simple barcode scan. By matching against an open purchase order, and finding the right line item, the item can be marked as <em>received</em> without any manual data entry on the part of the user. A data-driven automated barcode workflow can also reduce data entry errors.</p>

<p>To capitalize on this available data, InvenTree now supports scan-in of items received against purchase orders, from suppliers who support ECIA barcodes. A new barcode scan API endpoint is provided which handles all of the back-end operations.</p>

<p>Currently, the following suppliers are supported:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Digikey</li>
  <li>Mouser</li>
  <li>LCSC</li>
  <li>TME</li>
</ul>

<p>This functionality will be available in the upcoming <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.13.0</code> stable release.</p>

<h4 id="app-integration">App Integration</h4>

<p>The new purchase order barcode functionality is supported by the <a href="/extend/app.html">InvenTree mobile app</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/barcode_po_actions.png" alt="App barcode support" /></p>

<h4 id="web-integration">Web Integration</h4>

<p>We are working on integration into the web interface as part of our <a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/issues/5212">move to react</a></p>

<h4 id="further-workflows">Further Workflows</h4>

<p>Other advanced barcode workflows are also planned for future development, particularly around build orders and sales orders.</p>

<p>Note that barcodes functionality can also be extended by plugins as required, for custom integrations or features.</p>

<h3 id="app-barcode-scanner-support">App Barcode Scanner Support</h3>

<p>To further improve barcode support, the mobile app has been updated to work with external barcode scanners (in addition to providing barcode scanning using the internal camera). The new scanner support provides <a href="https://github.com/inventree/inventree-app/pull/437">keyboard wedge scanning</a>, which means that it can interface with any barcode scanners which act as virtual keyboards.</p>

<p>In addition to working with external bluetooth scanners, this means that the app is now supported on barcode scanners which natively run android:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/barcode_scanner.jpeg" alt="Barcode scanner" /></p>

<p>Any scanner which supports <em>wedge</em> or <em>keyboard</em> mode should now be able to integrate seamlessly with the InvenTree app.</p>

<h2 id="currency-exchange">Currency Exchange</h2>

<p>One key issue addressed in this release is a fix for fetching exchange rate information from the internet.</p>

<p>To date, InvenTree has made use of the <a href="https://exchangerate.host/">exchangerate.host</a> service for updating currency exchange rate data. This has (until now) been provided as a free service which did not require authentication.</p>

<p>However recent changes to the exchangerate backend have broken our exchange rate implementation, and required an immediate fix.</p>

<h3 id="frankfurterapp">frankfurter.app</h3>

<p>For now, the quick approach to get everyone up and running again is to migrate to using the <a href="https://www.frankfurter.app/">frankfurter.app</a> API. This provides a near-identical API, without needing an API key or paid subscription.</p>

<h3 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h3>

<p>Future work on supporting exchange rates will involve supporting different backend APIs, including the ability for users to provide their own API keys. We will also implement the ability for custom plugins to provide exchange rate data - allowing users to define their own exchange rate interface if required.</p>

KiCad is a very popular and capable tool, and has continually evolved to meet the changing needs of its users.</p>

<p>Ever since InvenTree was first <a href="https://forum.kicad.info/t/inventory-management-open-source/"><em>shamelessly cross-promoted</em></a> on the KiCad forums, I have been searching for a clean way to connect KiCad and InvenTree together. This has been a <a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/discussions/4133">popular topic of discussion</a> with other InvenTree users too!</p>

<p>InvenTree contains all of my part definition data and inventory management information, such as part parameters, supplier data, etc. If only there was a simply way to get all of that information directly out of InvenTree and into KiCad.</p>

<p>Well now, with great excitement, there is! InvenTree data can now be used as a first-class <em>symbol library</em> - with full support of all of InvenTree’s internal data!</p>

<h3 id="http-library-support">HTTP Library Support</h3>

<p>In September 2023, <a href="https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/merge_requests/1679">HTTP Library Support</a> was added to the KiCad application.</p>

<p>This feature allows KiCad library data to be retrieved from an external API endpoint, rather than a library file on the local filesystem. This is a groundbreaking change which allows us to leverage InvenTree’s existing capabilities to provide a fully-featured integration between the two software packages.</p>

<h3 id="inventree-plugin">InvenTree Plugin</h3>

<p>The same author who implemented the HTTP library support in KiCad has also released a <a href="https://github.com/afkiwers/inventree_kicad">plugin for InvenTree</a> which provides an API wrapper for the InvenTree database that conforms to the KiCad HTTP library standard.</p>

<p>What does this mean? Simply put, it means that you can now use your InvenTree database as a native KiCad library, and pull your InvenTree data directly in to your KiCad schematic.</p>

<h3 id="configuration-file">Configuration File</h3>

<p>Once the plugin is installed, a simple configuration file on the local computer is all that is required to connect to the InvenTree database. All that is required is the URL to the remote server (with the correct plugin extension) and an API token for authentication:</p>

<h3 id="categories-as-libraries">Categories as Libraries</h3>

<p>InvenTree <em>categories</em> can be used as separate <em>libraries</em> in the KiCad application. The InvenTree plugin allows the user to select which part categories are exposed to KiCad.</p>

<h3 id="parameters-as-fields">Parameters as Fields</h3>

<p>Part <em>parameters</em> are exposed to the KiCad symbol as <em>fields</em>. This means that any extra part information (stored as part parameters in InvenTree) is available to the KiCad symbols.</p>

<h4 id="default-values">Default Values</h4>

<p>Where certain KiCad values are not defined for a particular part, each <em>library category</em> can optionally specify attributes such as <em>Default Symbol</em> or <em>Default Footprint</em>. This allows a category to be defined where all parts may share a common symbol and/or footprint within KiCad.</p>

To provide a major facelift to InvenTree, we are migrating our entire user interface to the <a href="https://react.dev/">React</a> framework.</p>

<h3 id="a-brief-history">A Brief History</h3>

<p>The InvenTree software project started as a pure server-side app, with the pages rendered on the server using html template files, via the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> template engine. As the amount of data handled by InvenTree increased, this approach very quickly became untenable, with page loading times slowing noticeably.</p>

<p>A significant milestone came with the introduction of the REST API (we use the <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/">Django Rest Framework</a>). Now, the user interface could be separated from the data, which allowed some great improvements to the user experience. Now, content could be loaded dynamically via the API, and rendered on the client side using javascript.</p>

<p>While various improvements have been made, and new features implemented, this has been how the InvenTree user interface has functioned for a number of years. Functionality (and code) has grown somewhat organically, and without much in the way of an overarching design strategy.</p>

<p>A lot of the user interface is still dynamically rendered on the server, with the “gaps” filled in by the client (via API calls). This approach has some drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Inconsistent:</strong> There is no real guiding strategy as to which parts are rendered by the server or the client</li>
  <li><strong>Inefficient:</strong> Rendering UI elements on the server via templates is very slow, and we cannot make use of modern design patterns</li>
  <li><strong>Inscrutable:</strong> With a mix of server-side html and client-side javascript, it is very difficult to work out how a certain function works, and how to implement changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, it’s time for a clean break! Moving to a modern UI framework is a daunting task, but with some very clear benefits and provides a path into the future.</p>

<h3 id="design-goals">Design Goals</h3>

<p>The primary design goal for our refactor is to render the entire user interface dynamically, using React. To achieve this, we have to implement the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Update the API</li>
  <li>Reimplement the UI</li>
  <li>Test everything</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="update-api">Update API</h4>

<p>As it stands, the API currently provides the majority of required data to various interfaces, including the web interface, mobile app, and any third party integrations. However there are some data which are not currently accessible via the API, and rendered on-demand by the server. So, we need to ensure that all displayed data are available via API endpoints.</p>

<h4 id="reimplement-ui">Reimplement UI</h4>

<p>Every single page / view needs to be rewritten in React. While this is a lot of work, it will be significantly less work than it took to originally write it all in javascript. We can leverage the reusable components and design patterns provided by React to significantly reduce code duplication. Additionally, there are already a lot of “common” interface patterns (such as data tabulation) used in InvenTree which should cut down the required work.</p>

<h3 id="test-everything">Test Everything</h3>

<p>A big advantage of moving to a modern UI framework is the ability to enhance our unit testing. Currently, while the server code has good code coverage, the front-end code has very little. Our move to React will include a focus on test driven development, to ensure that our front-end is as bug free as is reasonably possible.</p>

<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>

<p>There are a number of significant advantages that this refactor will afford:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> A major driver here is a better user experience. The interface will be more “user friendly”, pages will load more smoothly, and the interface flow (should) feel more intuitive</li>
  <li><strong>Efficiency Gains:</strong> As the django server no longer has to render front-end code, it should me much more responsive for API requests</li>
  <li><strong>Improved API:</strong> As a necessary requirement, our API will be enhanced. Data availability and response times will be improved.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduce Served Load:</strong> By only loading data when necessary, we will drastically reduce the load on the server</li>
  <li><strong>Code Separation:</strong> Good separation of code between the server (API) and front-end (UI) will result in cleaner code</li>
  <li><strong>Better for Developers:</strong> By moving to a well-known modern framework, we will make it much easier for other developers to contribute to our codebase.</li>
  <li><strong>Future Development:</strong> We will have a clear path forward for development of modern, responsive interface features which are not possible with our current toolchain.</li>
  <li><strong>Easier Integrations:</strong> Developers can implement responsive integrations with external services or plugins</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="release-timeline">Release Timeline</h3>

<p>Currently, the “master” branch of InvenTree ships with the “legacy” interface, and the new interface (which we have codenamed “platform”). We will be shipping both interfaces side-by-side while we work on the development.</p>

<p>When the new interface is ready to be released, we will have a clean break, with the old interface removed entirely.</p>

<p>Our aim is to have the entire user interface rewritten by the end of the year. Ideally, with developer assistance we could have it done sooner!</p>

<p>You can track the progress of these tasks here - <a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/issues/5212">https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/issues/5212</a></p>

<h4 id="distributing-the-interface">Distributing the Interface</h4>

<p>The intent for distributing the UI is to bundle a set of <em>compiled</em> javascript files with the installer. This means that the install / upgrade process is seamless for users:</p>

<ul>
  <li>End users will not need to install node / npm / yarn / etc on their system</li>
  <li>UI files are compiled and minified, to reduce download size</li>
</ul>

<p>Developers will need to install the required development packages to build the user interface on their machine. This is managed by our requirements files.</p>

<h4 id="interface-preview">Interface Preview</h4>

<p>The new interface is currently shipping in the “master” branch of InvenTree, and can be accessed at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/platform/</code> URL. This is very much a work in progress, but is useful for users or developers who wish to see the progress of the overhaul, or (even better) help us develop it.</p>

<p>You can see the latest version on the demo site, at <a href="https://demo.inventree.org/platform/">https://demo.inventree.org/platform/</a></p>

<h4 id="development-assistance">Development Assistance</h4>

<p>One major goal of the refactor is to attract more developers by using a well-established modern framework.
