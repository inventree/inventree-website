<h3 id="preparations-for-0100">Preparations for 0.10.0</h3>

<p>Since the last release, we’ve been working on the next version of InvenTree, which will be 0.10.0. There are already 85 PRs merged into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch, and we’re expecting to release 0.10.0 in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>There will be a full blog post once we release but here are a few perks to look for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The option to use <a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/4072">Slovenian</a>. Around 7% are already translated - we need your help to get that number up. Head over to the <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/inventree">translation project</a> if you want to help with any language.</li>
  <li>Attach the current order schedule to your calendar (<a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/3858">3858</a>)</li>
  <li>Improvements for report rendering (<a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/4081">4081</a>) and a lot of improvements to the docs</li>
  <li>Get orders by their reference via the API (<a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/4083">4083</a>)</li>
  <li>Improvements for SSO - including the UI (<a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/4169">4169</a>, <a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/4263">4263</a>), better separation between local and SSO user management (<a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/4171">4171</a>) and restricting signups to specific domains (<a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/4172">4172</a>)</li>
  <li>Include alternative parts in your BOM exports (<a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/4203">4203</a>)</li>
  <li>A simple priority field for order (<a href="https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/4225">4225</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="website-updates">Website Updates</h3>

<p>The website got some UI fixes for mobile users and gained more icons. We also added a <a href="https://inventree.org/about/team">team section</a> and moved away from cookie-based analytics.</p>

<h3 id="plugin-list">Plugin List</h3>

<p>A new feature landed: the <a href="https://inventree.org/plugins">plugin list</a>.

<p>InvenTree now has a new website (the one you’re looking at right now), which is intended to act as a landing page for anyone wanting to learn more about InvenTree. This new website will provide general information about what InvenTree <em>is</em> and how it can be used.</p>

<p>We will share periodic updates on new features, which provides greater visibility into what the latest-and-greatest versions of InvenTree have to offer.</p>

<p>Additionally as the InvenTree community grows, we’ll share information on new plugins, or feature “show and tell” sections in our blog to show how InvenTree is being used around the world!</p>

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>

<p>inventree.org will no longer host the InvenTree software documentation. Documentation has been moved to <a href="https://docs.inventree.org">docs.inventree.org</a></p>

<p>The <a href="/demo.html">demo server</a> remains available at <a href="https://demo.inventree.org">demo.inventree.org</a></p>

<p>These news items will automatically show up for all admins in the <strong>homepage</strong> as the <em>lowest</em> category (starting with the next minor release <strong>0.9.0</strong>).
If you do not want to see them there you can <strong>disable</strong> the function in your user-settings. There is also the option to disable news globally in the general server settings.</p>

<h3 id="but-why">But why?</h3>
<p>The good news first: We will <strong>not</strong> spam you with this function daily.<br />
It is more of a tool to <em>communicate</em> with the <em>power users</em> and <em>admins</em>. There is wide array of reasons for the dev-team to want to communicate with you.<br />
For example when we</p>
<ul>
  <li>are looking for inputs on new big, roadmap worthy FRs</li>
  <li>want to show you a cool show-and-tell as an inspiration</li>
  <li>have security advisories (please also follow releases - we always try to push new releases as fast as possible)</li>
  <li>are planning to depreciate a function and want to gauge if there are still users</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h3>
<p>Like the update-checks we are using the infrastructure GitHub provides.<br />
While the checks use the GitHub APIs, news are gathered from an <strong>RSS-feed</strong> that is served via <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>. The Jekyll-based website generates through a <strong>GitHub Action</strong> and then passes the <strong>static output</strong> to Pages, where it gets hosted for free (thank you GitHub) and delivered through CDNs worldwide.
On your InvenTree instance the <strong>background worker</strong> loads the RSS-feed on a regular basis and creates <strong>entries</strong> for the news items and <strong>notifications</strong> for all applicable users.</p>

<h3 id="and-my-data">And my data?</h3>
<p>As listed above we are using GitHub pages for this feature. We are not introducing additional trackers to that so the <a href="https://docs.inventree.org/en/latest/privacy/">general InvenTree privacy statement</a> applies.<br />
The short version: we <strong>do not sell your data</strong> or share it with third parties. We cannot guarantee what readthedocs and GitHub do with the metrics. We might use them as a metric for the stats section of the site. However, we get very little <em>actionable</em> information from that, a screenshot of the total info available is shown below.</p>
